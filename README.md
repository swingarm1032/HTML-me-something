# HTML-me-something
Name -- David Huckshold||  Unit 2, large assignment 1 (HTML-me-something)||  
This is a project for the St. Loius LaunchCode LC-101 Class, Winter Term, 2017
It is a web site/page about something I had made that I am really passionate about.
The page is my first big project in the HTML and CSS as well.
