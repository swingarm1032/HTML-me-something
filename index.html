  <h1>Introduction:</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I would like to introduce someone quite special to me, Shamu.  Who is this Shamu I am referring to? He is a giant inflatable Southwest Airlines plane of whom I love dearly.  Shamu is, as his name implies; an Orca or Killer Whale themed airplane.  His paint scheme is that of the Southwest Airlines Sea World Adventure Parks plane, which is commonly referred to as 'Shamu-one' which is where his name comes from.  Like I said earlier, Shamu is an inflatable airplane, and I designed him off of a much smaller inflatable airplane that I had already owned.  Shamu is also a very big inflatable airplane; he is 6 feet long and has as 6 foot wingspan as well, and his total height is about 2 feet.  He is easily big enough to be a pool float as well and I feel that if I would be granted such an opportunity, that I would greatly enjoy taking him for a ride in the water as well.

    Shamu is a custom made inflatable airplane as well, he was made by Hongyi Toy Manufacturing in Guangzhou, China, and they quite a few custom or one of a kind projects like him.  I first did business with Hongyi in December of 2015. Since then I have bought a total of five very large inflatable pool toys from them, all of them except the first were custom designed by me, or in the case if the fourth one, a person who I have as a personal Skype contact.  I would like to say that I am a collector of inflatable toys and I enjoy them a lot as well.  It is hard for me to explain why, but I would also like to say that most of my collection is either vintage, unusually classified, or custom made.  Hongyi is a small quantity manufacturer, with a very low minimum order quantity, which is usually 1.  They make their items by hand and are although hand-made, very high quality.  They use double welded seams, which in other words means that the seams are welded in two strips along the seam, which adds to the overall seam strength.  The seams on their items are also quite thick, but in the creation process are ironed flat along the inflastable's surface.  The combination of these things make for a much stronger and also better looking inflatable, and their quality is worth their pricing, which to someone who is not familiar with the costs of making a custom toy, would seem quite high.

  <h1>Shamu's Design:</h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      To go into more detail about Shamu's design, I had used a much smaller airplane to derive his design, which in fact is essentially a scaled-up version of this plane. He is a Boeing 737-400 aircraft, which at the time the actual plane was flown, was the main airplane that Southwest Airlines had used in their fleet.  He is a two-engine plane with slightly swept back wings and a medium build Fuselage.  Hs body is a single air chamber, which means he is filled up entirely through one air valve  and the air as he is being filled flows into the smaller parts of his body, such as his engines and tail fins.  His air valve, located on his right tail on the rear portion of the fuselage, is also noteworthy.  It is a two-part quick release valve, which the outer part opens for inflation and the inner part opens for deflation.  He was printed with the use of UV Printing, which is a newer and better way that printing is done on large surfaces, such as the parts that make up his body.

  <h1>About Shamu's Air Valve:</h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      Shamu's air valve is not your average type air valve in more than a few ways.  To start with a general note, the outer part can be left open and he will stay inflated with no air loss.  However, when the inner part is opened he loses almost all his inflation in about 30 seconds.  The way his valve works is that there is a gasket inserted in a plug that fits into the inner part of the valve, and with the outer part of the valve open, air flows against this gasket and it seals the opening of the outer part, which when air is being pumped into him, the gasket is pushed open by the flow of air in, thus air can go in but not out.  I assume that with the cap on the outer part of the valve, the gasket is still being sealed shut inside the inner part as well.  Now on the other hand if I need to let the air out of him, I just remove the whole outer assembly from the stem of the valve, which is tightly fitting enough to not let air out, but not so tightly fitting that it cannot be removed from the stem. The inner valve stem is about the diameter of a quarter so the air flows out very fast, but because the plug fits so tightly, I don't have to worry about the plug accidentally coming lose while I am riding him in the water, or while I have him blown up and am playing with him elsewise.

  <h1>Creating Shamu</h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      The creation of Shamu was also a noteworthy project, as I had used a smaller inflatable airplane to create a set of drawings to scale the original item to a length of 72 inches.  The original is 18 inches long so essentially the scale of Shamu was 4x that of the original.  I did the drawings in AutoCAD 2016 and made notes on them as well as to how the construction was done and other related notes.  Due to the fact that the company is situated in China, I had to do metric conversions on the drawings as well, which to do so I just multiplied by 2.54 to get the number of centimeters, and I rounded to the nearest centimeter, which is their standard unit in production.  I also used a number of photos of the original to recreate the graphics Shamu's body, which in my opinion turned out really good, I did notice one place where the graphics on Shamu did not match the original, but it was just a small graphical error, and also was not well explained or shown in the photos.  The material thickness of Shamu's skin is 0.3 mm which is equal to 12-gauge PVC, which is used on some of the older and higher quality pool toys by brands such as Intex and Bestway.  I had at first planned on using 0.4 mm PVC (16-gauge equivalent) which is really good and about the best thickness combination for very large inflatables, but I changed the thickness to 0.3 mm to save a bit on Shamu's production costs. I have to say that it appears that this change has not caused and significant quality change, and he is able to support me laying on his back on my bed from time to time easily.

  <h1>About My Other Hongyi Inflatables</h1>
  <article>
    <p>
      As I said earlier, Shamu is my fifth item that Hongyi Toy Manufacturing has made for me. The first one, which was one of their standard productions was a large shark, it is about 10.5 feet long and the main color of its body is black.  It is 0.4 mm PVC, and is named Obsidian for its black color.  The second one I had made was my first custom designed inflatable, which was designed to look like the player's ship from my favorite computer game, Descent II.  It is a mostly grey spaceship, with 4 laser cannons and large tail fins.  The body of this one was constructed in an unusual way, Hongyi had used ropes to secure the top and bottom of the main body in a fashion similar to a French mattress, this was not how I would have constructed the body, and I feel that this rope structure creates a weakness if I were to ride it.  The third one is also really special to me, it is an 11 foot SR-71 'Blackbird' plane.  This one I had used AutoCAD again to create the shape schematics and body designs for the production.  The visual printed designs are derived form a much smaller inflatable plane, which was made by Rhode Island Novelty CO.  The size of this one though came from another large one, which is in the brand "ICF Toys" which is owned by another inflatable collector and hobbyist creator.  The fourth one was the one that was designed by someone who I know remotely and have on Skype.  This design was that of an F-18 which is one of Boeing's fighter jets.  The guy lives in Japan and goes by Spacetime511PSD. I do not know what all that stands for, but he is a big fanatic of the Hongyi made inflatables and has a job in CGI I believe.  His model for the F-18 was done in 3D in the Autodesk Maya program and the finished item looked really good. I should state that he designed one for himself here and my Hongyi contact showed me the plane that he had designed, which at the time I could not attribute to him but I had a good idea that he was the creator of it, and a week or so later he posts a few videos of it on his YouTube channel, which at that point I knew he was the creator of it.  Finally going to the fifth creation, who is Shamu. I have already said a huge amount about him here, so I am going to outline the project for the sixth which I have planned, it is a 10.5 foot hammerhead shark, again custom design, but based on an existing design that was made by Sunco – now out of business – in 2006, and this design is again very special to me.
